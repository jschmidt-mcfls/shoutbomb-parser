Take the Shoutbomb email of monthly statistics and place into a spreadsheet
Download these files to a directory and place two folders in that directory as well: one called input, one called output.  Save the Shoutbomb monthly statistics email to the input folder and save it as a text file (.txt).  When running the .bat file, enter the file name of the stats exactly as it appears in the input folder. The output folder will have the new statistical spreadsheet.
